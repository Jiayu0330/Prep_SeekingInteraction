      <p>This is a data Visualization about "U.S. population by age group" from 1950 to 2060.
         The left side represents the percentage of male at different ages in a given year, while the
         right side stands for female. The x-axis is percentage and the y-axis is time period. </p>

      <div class="animationImage">
        <img src="img/animation.PNG" alt="animation" width="148" height="37" />
      </div>
      <p>In the bottom right, there is an animation control icon that you can click to watch the animation,
         which will go through the change of population percentage from 1950 to 2060. In D3, we can use "on"
         function to get "click" from the icon and achieve such animation by keeping updating dataset. Then,
         we can add transition and duration to make the animation look smooth.</p>

    <div class="interaction">

      <div class="interactionImage">
        <img src="img/interaction.PNG" alt="interaction" width="621.5" height="488.5" />
      </div>
      <p>If you hover on bars, details will show on the bars, including ages and the percentage of female
         and male in the year. In D3, we can achieve this by using HTML div elements as tooltips to print
         out the detailed information on each bar.</p>
      <img src="img/interaction2.PNG" alt="interaction2" width="146" height="580" />
      <p> Also, you can select data for specific year. In D3, we can still use "on" function to get "click"
          and then update the dataset and the chart for that year.</p>
